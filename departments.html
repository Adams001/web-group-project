                    <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br>
                        The programme of Geography at the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University is aimed and geared
                        towards scientific geography and the application of scientific methods, techniques and knowledge
                        of geography towards tackling environmental, planning and developmental problems in Nigeria. It
                        is also aimed at maximizing benefits and minimizing cost and damages to human behaviour in
                        relation to the prevailing environment. This is achieved by attempting to research, describe,
                        explain, predict and where possible control human behaviour and/or the physical, social and
                        cultural environments. The programme is designed to help students understand the problem of
                        their social and physical environment and also to develop a critical judgment which will enable
                        them to be creative and self-reliant and make rational objective choices in contributing to
                        issues relating to their communities.</p>

                        Level. Students are encouraged to carry out their final year projects in any of the diversified
                        subject areas covering climatology and meteorology, hydrology and water resources management,
                        geomorphology and soil studies, geographic information system (GIS), surveying, remote sensing,
                        economic geography, transportation geography, population studies, urban planning and rural

                    <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br>
                        Physics Department is one of the pioneer Departments created in year 2006. The Department runs
                        Physics degree programme leading to award of B.Sc Physics Degree.
                        The Department started with 7 academic staff, one technical staff and 8 pioneer students under
                        the Headship of Dr. BabaAlfa.
                        The Department at inception started along with other Science Departments in a block of building
                        with one laboratory and class rooms which it shared with others. Currently the Department is
                        housed in a block of building with four 4 laboratories, 4 class rooms, 1 conference room and 12
                        offices. One of the University cyber cafés with about 40 desktop computers is located within the
                        building.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>PHYSICS CURRICULUM</strong><br>
                        Physics is a fundamental science, forming the basis of most of the technologies. Physics,
                        originally called ‘Natural Philosophy’ includes the study of the whole nature. Today, Physics is
                        described as the study of the properties of matter and energy. Traditional branches of Physics
                        include: Mechanics, Properties of matter, Heat and Thermodynamics. Light, Sound, Electricity and
                        Magnetism, Atomic and Molecular Physics, Geophysics, Atmospheric Physics, Environmental Physics,
                        Climatology and Meteorology just to mention a few. New fields are emerging as science and
                        technology develops. Today, Physics has assumed a greater importance than ever on account of its
                        unprecedented advance in experimental techniques, its industrial applications and the influence
                        of its ideas on contemporary thought.
                        <br>
                        The B.Sc. Physics curriculum is designed to impact competence in the fundamental aspects of the
                        major branches of experimental and theoretical Physics. The understanding of the theoretical
                        aspect requires competence in Mathematics relevant to the courses. These are either taught along
                        with the Physics courses or are taken from Mathematics Department, if available. For the
                        understanding of the experimental aspect of the curriculum, a number of suitably designed basic
                        and advanced experiments are performed each semester. Other required courses are taken from
                        Chemistry Department and General Studies Directorate. The B.Sc Physics is an eight (8) semester
                        full time course, with Students Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) designed to give the
                        student a broad understanding in a wide spectrum of knowledge embodied in the subject. At final
                        year the student is expected to carry out theoretical or experimental research on a selected
                        topic under the supervision of academic staff</p>

                    <p><strong>PHILOSOPHY, GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</strong><br>
                        <strong>PHILOSOPHY</strong><br>
                        Physics as a discipline is involved in the objective investigation of the interactions of the
                        forces of nature with matter. These investigations are basically empirical and experimental
                        approach serves as confirmation of, or leads to new theoretical formulations in a mutually
                        reciprocal relationship. This curriculum incorporates experimental and applied studies based on
                        a sound theoretical background,
                        <br>
                        <strong>GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</strong><br>
                        The goal of this curriculum is to produce graduates grounded in the basic theories of Physics,
                        experimental techniques and theoretical applications. It is our goal to produce world class
                        Physics graduates and prepare our graduates for careers in research and development, teaching or
                        for entry into some specific technological professions. We therefore, aim at imparting an
                        appreciation of current problems modern techniques and trends in Physics. The programme is
                        therefore structured to:

                            <li>Instill in students a sense of enthusiasm for physics, and appreciation of its
                                applications in different contexts.</li>
                            <li>Involve the students in intellectually simulation and satisf’ing experience of learning

                            <li>Develop in students the ability to apply their knowledge and skills in physics to the
                                solution of theoretical and practical problems.</li>
                            <li>Develop in students through an education in physics, a range of transferable skills of
                                value in physics and other areas.</li>
                            <li>Provide students with a knowledge and skills base for further studies in physics.
